        <P>The most unforgettable group was Kangeshwaran, Chalukya, Bharath, and Vijay each famous for their own madness. Kangeshwaran was the unstoppable roasting king, always ready with a punchline sharp enough to make even teachers rethink their life choices. He spent half the day roasting every student in the class, while the smartest student quietly continued studying, completely unfazed by his nonstop comedy. Chalukya, the master scammer, could walk into any shop and walk out without paying—nobody knew how, not even him. Bharath happily supported every one of Chalukya’s “missions,” bunking classes with a smile and creating distractions like a professional. Meanwhile, Vijay spent most of his college hours sleeping on the last bench, only to wake up in the evening and transform into a “gym guy,” impressing gym girls with lies stronger than any weight he could lift. Together, this chaotic squad turned every day into a comedy show—one roasting, one scamming, one enjoying, and one sleeping—yet somehow they remained the most legendary group the college had ever seen.</P>
